# Computing Real-World Coordinates Using Collinearity Conditions

This project demonstrates how to compute the real-world (object-space) coordinates of a common object visible in two different images using **collinearity conditions** in photogrammetry.

## Overview
Collinearity conditions define the mathematical relationship between an object's **real-world coordinates**, its **image-space coordinates**, and the camera's **exterior and interior orientation parameters**. By leveraging these conditions, we can determine the **3D position of an object** when captured from two different perspectives.

## Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Coordinate Acquisition
- Identify the object in two different images and extract its **pixel coordinates**:
- Ensure **camera calibration parameters** (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) are available.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOPs)
- The camera's position **(X‚ÇÄ, Y‚ÇÄ, Z‚ÇÄ)** and **rotation matrix (R)** at the time of image capture must be known.
- These parameters are typically obtained via:
- **Aerial triangulation**
- **GNSS/IMU integration** for sensor positioning

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Collinearity Equations
Each image point must satisfy the collinearity condition:
```math
$$
x = -f \frac{r_{11}(X - X_0) + r_{12}(Y - Y_0) + r_{13}(Z - Z_0)}{r_{31}(X - X_0) + r_{32}(Y - Y_0) + r_{33}(Z - Z_0)}
$$

$$
y = -f \frac{r_{21}(X - X_0) + r_{22}(Y - Y_0) + r_{23}(Z - Z_0)}{r_{31}(X - X_0) + r_{32}(Y - Y_0) + r_{33}(Z - Z_0)}
$$

**Where:**  
- \( (X, Y, Z) \) = Unknown **object-space coordinates**  
- \( (X_0, Y_0, Z_0) \) = Camera position (Exterior Orientation)  
- \( R = [r_{ij}] \) = **3√ó3 Rotation Matrix**  
- \( f \) = Camera **focal length**  
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Space Intersection Computation
- Given **two images** with known orientation parameters, we solve the **collinearity equations simultaneously**.
- This results in a **least squares adjustment**, estimating the best real-world position of the object.
